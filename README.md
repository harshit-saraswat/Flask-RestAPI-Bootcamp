# Flask-RestAPI-Bootcamp
This repo contains all the codes and files used during the Flask RestAPI Bootcamp during DataEthics4All #Ethics4NGAI Hackathon.

The [Deployment-Flask-Master](https://github.com/harshit-saraswat/Flask-RestAPI-Bootcamp/tree/master/Codes/Deployment-flask-master) was taken from [Krish Naik](https://github.com/krishnaik06)'s repo [here](https://github.com/krishnaik06/Deployment-flask). 
I have added the main.py file to it for REST API implementation for the same.

Apart from that all the images are taken from a quick Google Search for those images.
